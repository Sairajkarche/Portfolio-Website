                <p>Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
                    Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.Python can 
                    connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.Python
                    can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.Python 
                    can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.</p>

                    <p>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
                        Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.Python has syntax 
                        that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming
                        languages.Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon
                        as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.Python can be treated in
                        a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</p>

                        <p>The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall
                        be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated
                        with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.In this
                        tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write
                        Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, 
                        Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections
                        of Python files.</p>

                            <p>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English
                            language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a
                            command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or 
                            parentheses.Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such
                            as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often
                            use curly-brackets for this purpose.</p>
